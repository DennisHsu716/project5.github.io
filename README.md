# 🛒 E-Commerce Web Application Development
[Project Page](https://dennishsu716.github.io/project5.github.io/project3/project3.html)
## 📝 Summary  
This project showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a responsive, interactive, and visually appealing e-commerce front-end web application. It aims to strengthen front-end development skills by guiding users through the full process — from layout structuring to dynamic behavior implementation.
* **HTML:** Provides the page structure (header, navbar, product grid, footer).
* **CSS:** Responsible for styling, layout design, color scheme, animations, and responsiveness via media queries.
* **JavaScript:** Implements functionality such as form handling, interactive menus, product interactions, and DOM manipulation.
Advanced users can expand this structure by integrating front-end frameworks like React or Vue.js.

## 🔭 Future Plans
* Integrate real-time APIs (e.g., product database, user login, cart functions)
* Add localStorage for cart data persistence
* Enhance accessibility and mobile-first optimizations
* Expand to a full-stack app using frameworks like:
        * React + Node.js
        * Vue + Firebase
        * Django + REST API

##🧠 Skills Gained
* Modular web layout planning
* Responsive web design using media queries
* DOM event handling and dynamic UI components
* Code organization and separation of concerns (HTML/CSS/JS)
